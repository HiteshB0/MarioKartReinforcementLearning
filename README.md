# This project involves a Mario Kart simulation that learns to navigate a modified Mario Kart track using reinforcement learning. 
### It learns the track and finds the best route based on its speed and rotation. (which can be modified)
###### The car which finishes the fastest lap will be displayed on the screen and cooldown implemented to prevent overlapping.
